# TTT4275_project
Project in Estimation, Detection and Classification at NTNU. Here we have done the classification project, with Iris flower and MNIST.
The task done, can be found in the TTT4275_project folder as pdf.
Project result: 50/50.
## Getting Started

Clone the project to a folder of your choice. Remember to be in that folder when running the command
```
git clone https://github.com/VegardIversen/TTT4275_project.git
```
and go into the folder
```
cd TTT4275_project
```

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
You need a computer with python, here used Python version 3.8.2, but should work with Python 3.
Pip is needed
The datasets are included in the folder.




### Installing



Install requirements.txt (watch out for missing libs)
```
pip install -r requirements
```


## Running the tests

Run the entire project from the TTT4275_project folder with (using py, but some versions of Python uses python to run)

```
py runproject.py
```

By moving into the different folders, you could run the task individually. This is useful if you want to change some global variables, or save the images by sending s=True in the task functions. Havent made it possible to do that from runproject.py yet.

## Note
A lot of this code is just many quick fixes. There is probably some bugs. 
Have also made the algorithms into classes just for fun and to learn how to use classes.
